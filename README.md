## Part 1: Tutorial ##

Welcome to **GitHub**! Assuming you followed the guide to get Webstorm and **GIT** installed located on the PowerPoint presentation shown in class, you should now be able to create **repositories** for your future assignments and projects! To start off, you can either create a repository through the GitHub home page or through WebStorm. If you make it on GitHub, you'll have to **clone** it onto your local machine. Once you have it set up, your respository will have one **branch** called master. From WebStorm, you can **commit** changes that you make to your local branch and then **push** new changes to the **remote**. If something goes wrong, you can always **pull** an older version of your program from the remote. In fact, you can even be more safe and **fetch** the older version so you can see the differences and where you went wrong. If you make another branch to test things, which you should, you can then **merge** them together once you feel like your tests are stable enough for the main branch. You can also use this feature to work on projects with others. However, if two changes happen to the same line of code, a **merge conflict** will occur and will have to be sorted out.

## Part 2: Glossary ##

- Branch - a side version of a repository contained within the repository, but with its own changes. Eventually, it may get merged back into the main branch.
- Clone - a local copy of a repository.
- Commit - an update to a project, normally with a small message describing the changes.
- Fetch - to pull a version of a project from the repository and review the differenced before committing them into your project.
- GIT - GIT is a version control system. All of the other definitions here aside from GitHub are words that were defined by GIT.
- GitHub - GitHub is an online implementation of GIT so that you can have your code in an online environment. It works extremely well as a portfolio as well.
- Merge - to combine two branches of a program together so that they become equally updated at the end of it.
- Merge Conflict - if two people change the same line and merge the branches, this happens. It needs to be resolved before either merge goes through.
- Push - to send your code from your local machine to the remote.
- Pull - takes a version of your project from the repository and make it your current working branch. This is a more direct version of fetching.
- Remote - an online environment where repositories are held. GitHub is a remote.
- Repository - this is where everything in your project is located. It can easily be thought of as a main folder.
